# 911-Emergency-Calls-Analysis

## Emergency Response Analysis: 911 Calls Data

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing and visualizing emergency call data (911 calls) to uncover valuable insights, trends, and patterns that can help improve emergency response strategies. The analysis aims to understand the distribution of calls, peak times, call types, and other factors that influence emergency response efficiency. By visualizing the data with advanced techniques, the project highlights key characteristics and trends to better inform decision-making processes for emergency services.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction & Analysis**: In-depth analysis of 911 emergency call data, with the goal of uncovering actionable insights about response times, call distributions, and other metrics.
- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Utilized various data visualization techniques including:
  - **Bar Plots**: To show the distribution of emergency calls across different categories.
  - **Line Plots**: To track trends in call volumes over time.
  - **Heatmaps**: To visualize the geographical and time-based distribution of calls.
  
## Technologies Used

- Python
  - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
- Data Analysis & Visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
